Ideas:
- Maybe make it learn a player twice: for black and for white
- Perhaps simply the board state is not good enough for input. Maybe
responsibilities, threats, etc. would be better
- For the current iteration, have it study players that are good at positional
chess

New goal: the strongest AI that doesn't calculate
